Rubix-Space
===========

Rubix-Space is an arbitrary term used to describe the small Rubix Cube-like map from which we are initially doing our map testing.

- We'll start with a public server of about 10 thousand rooms, ie a 100x100x100 grid.

- The goal on this initial map, for players, is to traverse from one side of the map to the destination "port" safely, without dying to other players or to npc roadblocks along the way.

- Room "exits" can change randomly in some parts of space. 

- Adding on that, some rooms may not have an exit for a period of time, but may still have an entrance.
