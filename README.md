The M-Paradox Sci-Fi MUD Repo


- Initial mapping will be limited to "Rubix-Space", a very small 3-dimensional grid from which we will experiment with ship traversal and mapping mechanics.

- We're going to put together a wiki of terms and instructions. Reading this is going to be mandatory for getting a footing in the game.

- No graphics.
